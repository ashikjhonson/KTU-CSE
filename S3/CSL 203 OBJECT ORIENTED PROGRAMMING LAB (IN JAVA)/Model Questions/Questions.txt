* Implement a Java program to read a number from the console. The program 
should check whether the number is prime or not and display the result in a 
file (Folder name: ConsolePrime)

* Implement a Java program to create a class called as “Number” with a data 
member called limit. A class called as “Compute” inherits this class and has a 
method called “secLargest” to display the second largest of an array of 
numbers. The limit for the array should be used from the “Number” class. (SecLargest)

* Implement a Java program to read a number in a file called “input.txt”. Read 
that number from the file and display Fibonacci series up to that limit in 
another file called “output.txt” (FiboFile)

* Implement a Java program to generate the layout given below. When the user 
enters numbers in the text fields labelled Number1 and Number2 and clicks on 
the button labelled Calculate the larger of the two numbers must be displayed 
in the text field labelled Result. (SwingLarger)

* Implement a Java program to create an interface called “Number” with a 
method called “display”. Two classes “NoDuplicate” and “Sum” inherits this 
class. NoDuplicate class should remove the duplicate elements in an array. 
Sum class should calculate the sum of digits of a number. Both classes should 
use display method to print the result (Number)

* Implement a Java program to create a class called “Matrix”. Use a method 
called “input” to read elements of the matrix. Use another method “output” to 
display the elements of the matrix. Inherit a class called “MatTranspose”. Use 
a method called “transpose” to display the transpose of the matrix. (Matrix)

* Implement a Java program to read two numbers in a file called “input.txt”. Use 
“output.txt” file to display prime numbers between this given limit (FilePrime)
